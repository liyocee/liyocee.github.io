  - heading: Opened Xcode
    content:
    - I worked from the basement of Ashley's mother's house (there was no WiFi so I had to connect directly to their modem with ethernet). Armed with cs193p courses from Stanford (instructed that year by Evan Doll), I learnt the basics of iOS app structure.
    - I also had a few reference books and some help from a friend. <a href='http://twitter.com/jasonbrennan'>Jason Brennan</a> and I talked a lot over Google Wave. He helped me with everything from syntax of Objective-C to quirks of Xcode.

  - heading: Coffee Timer
    content:
    - "This was to be my first app. I wanted to create something that I would want to use. I really liked using a coffee press but would often forget it was brewing and spoil the coffee. A timer to make coffee would be perfect: simple enough to execute but meaningful enough to motivate me."
    - "The app was pretty simple: some models were deserialized from NSUserDefaults, presented in a table view, blah blah blah. It wasn't much, but it was mine and I was proud of it. Seeing my software run on my iPod touch for the first time was as close to a religious experience as I've ever had."
