<!-- PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY -->
I've been around for 26 years, tried to reinvent my life severally, failed terribly,
<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

1. Sex is a painkiller
2. Exercise of mental clarity, a chase for a bitch body is a goose chase
3. Google/Research people before meeting them - Learn about their interests, things they are passionate about and hobbies
4.Stay grounded, be humble and have empathy and be nice to people- For your current reality is someone's dream
5. Never crave for social validation, external validation, especially in this **likes** craze days
6.Happiness = Reality/Expectations
7. The grind, the process of building something is as fascinating than the end
8. Never aspire for drastic big shots changes in your life, endevor for small, progressive change
9.The power of compounding, 1% compounded everyday is 36000 in a year.Figure out how to improve 1% everyday on things
you deeply care about
10. Dont burn bridges,,you always connect the dots looking backwards
12.You are damned if you do and damned if you don't , so you better do and f**k those critics
13, The fewer things you own, the fewer things own you
14. You can never know how it feels like unless you are in the arena, with your sleeves rolled up and
that sweat trickling down,,
