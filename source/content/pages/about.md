Hello, Thanks for stopping by :-)

Right here is  Liyosi Collins, a techpreneur, a machine learning enthusiast, a writer and a creative.

This guy Liyosi is intrigued by technology and more so how it can be leveraged by businesses and society
to surmount challenges that have and continue to bedevil us.

I:

- Write software <Yeah, software is eating the world>
- Consult with early-stage technology startups  ** <and> **
- Revel in helping lower the digital divide to ensure technology is truly democratised and ubiquitous


I have keen interests in **Machine Learning** and I envision a future where data will be the gem for computing.
A future that is data driven, where computing will mimic human's intelligence and totally **augment** our lives.


In our entangled web, I can be found around the following corners: < you peek at them :-) >
