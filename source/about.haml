        I am a world-class software developer living in New Yorkâ€™s East Village. The last [five years of my life](https://ashfurrow.com/blog/5-years-of-ios/) have been focused on iOS development, but I dabble. I have two cats, and when Iâ€™m not [contributing in open source](https://github.com/ashfurrow), I like to [write books](https://leanpub.com/u/theashfurrow) and [make photos](http://photos.ashfurrow.com).

        Community is incredibly important to me; Iâ€™ve only been able to accomplish what I have because of the kindness and generosity of others. I owe it to the people who helped me to help others now. I want to lead by example and become the kind of developer that I would want to work with. That means sharing knowledge, code, and time with others. To that end, Iâ€™ve been working toward becoming [Open Source by Default](http://code.dblock.org/2015/02/09/becoming-open-source-by-default.html) in all aspects of my life.

        Over my career, Iâ€™ve been fortunate to work at some amazing places.

        ### Artsy

        The goal of [Artsy](https://www.artsy.net) is simple, but ambitious: make art as popular as music. Here, I work on a team to build Artsyâ€™s different iOS apps â€“ [all of which are open source](http://www.objc.io/issue-22/artsy.html), which is amazing ðŸŽ‰

        ### Teehan+Lax

        After learning the importance of design at 500px, I moved to [Teehan+Lax](http://www.teehanlax.com) â€“ Canadaâ€™s leading design agency â€“ to learn more. I developed keen collaboration skills while working closely with designers and clients to realize outstanding products.

        ### 500px

        [500px](https://500px.com/) is a site that aims to host the worldâ€™s best photography. Like Flickr, but only for your _best_ shots. I developed their first iPad app, and later led the iOS team to ship the new universal app.
