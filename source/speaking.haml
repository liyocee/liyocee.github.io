          Usually I like to deliver a combination of technical knowledge and inspirational messages. Context for technical know-how is critical. Understanding _what_ you’re doing is poitnless if you don’t understand _why_ you’re doing it.

          If you’re interested in having me speak, [get in touch](mailto:ash@ashfurrow.com).
